# AutoNav Challenge - Senior Design Project (Team of 4)

_This repository exclusively contains my work on the line detection algorithm. It does not contain the remainder of our ROS nodes and classes._

The goal of our project is to design and build an autonomous robot that uses line following, obstacle avoidance, and GPS waypoint navigation technologies to safely and effectively follow a course consisting of a lane and road obstacles.

The primary objective is to complete the IGVC obstacle course and pave the way for future teams to continue the development of machine learning and GPS technology.
