# AutoNav Challenge - Senior Design Project (Team of 4)

The goal of our project is to design and build an autonomous robot that uses line following, obstacle avoidance, and GPS waypoint navigation technologies to safely and effectively follow a course consisting of a lane and road obstacles.

The primary objective is to complete the IGVC obstacle course and pave the way for future teams to continue the development of machine learning and GPS technology.
